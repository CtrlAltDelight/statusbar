# statusbar
Creating my statusbar. Tested on dwm but I'm sure it can be adapted to many different purposes.

# TODO
- Make as many modules reactive as possible
    - less reliance on update timing and will feel more responsive
- volume level module
- email
    - how many unread
    - little email emoticon
- weather
    - shows emoji
    - temperature
    - how long it will rain perhaps
- moon phase
    - shows respective emoji
- music player status
    - must work well with spotifyd
- calendar events
    - this will probably involve working with a specific calendar application
- task tracking softwares status
    - which task tracker to use?
- keyboard layout
    - language/qwerty-workman-etc.
- make a config file to read from that can toggle which modules are active
- make it so you can reorder it in the config
